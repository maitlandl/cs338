I completed all steps in the instructions (which were very clear, thank you!).
I have a "VMware Fusion" application with "Kali" and "Metasploitable2". The status for both is "suspended".
I plan to use my laptop for most assignments because I am not sure if work can be transferred between my laptop and a lab computer.
